    <h1>MagPy4 Help</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>MagPy4 simplifies the analysis of magnetic field data. Using the program, you can examine the three components
        of the vector magnetic field and the total magnetic field as a function of time. When you have identified an
        interesting segment of data, you can apply any one of a series of standard analysis tools to that data. You can
        use the characteristics of the data to choose more natural coordinate systems in which to display the data. You
        can filter the data, perform Fourier analysis of the data, and so on.</p>
    <h2>Menu Commands</h2>
    <h3>File</h3>
    <p>The File menu allows you to open and add flat files, and to open CDF files.</p>
    <h3>Tools &gt; Data</h3>
    <p>The Data window allows you to view all the information about the data contained in the files you opened. It also
        allows you to choose a specific time or a specific data row and to view the corresponding magnetic field data.</p>
    <h3>Tools &gt; Plot</h3>
    <p>The Plot window allows you to add plots to the program's main window or to remove plots that are already
        displayed there. You can also clear all plots from the window. You can choose which components of the magnetic
        field data to plot.</p>
    <h3>Tools &gt; Spectra</h3>
    <p>After selecting a time interval in the program's main window, the Spectra window displays the power spectrum of
        the magnetic field signals, the coherence and the phase difference between any two components of the magnetic
        field. The Spectra windows also allows you to perform wave analysis.</p>
    <h4>Power spectrum</h4>
    <p>A digital signal containing <i>n</i> points sampled every <i>&Delta;t</i> is <i>n&Delta;t</i> seconds long. The
        lowest frequency that can be accurately determined in this finite length time series is <i>n&Delta;t-1</i> and
        the highest is <i>2&Delta;t-1</i> because two data points are required to define a wave. This maximum frequency
        is called the
        Nyquist frequency. Fast Fourier transform routines can transform a time series of fluctuations of one component
        of magnetic field signals into a series of cosine and sine amplitudes:</p>
    <p><i>C<sub>0</sub></i>, <i>C<sub>1</sub></i>, &hellip;, <i>C<sub>n/2-1</sub></i></p>
    <p><i>S<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>S<sub>2</sub></i>, &hellip;, <i>S<sub>n/2</sub></i></p>
    <p>If there are three orthogonal measurements of wave amplitudes in direction x, y, and z, we can form the
        cospectral matrix of variances and cross variances at each frequency <i>i</i>: <span class='attention'>MISSING
            TEXT HERE</span></p>
    <p>This matrix is the cospectral density of the signal.</p>
    <p>If averaging the sum of the diagonal terms over frequency, the plot would show the power spectral
        density of the signal versus frequency, which is called the power frequency.</p>
    <h4>Wave Analysis</h4>
    <p>The cospectrum matrix is the real part of the spectrum matrix. The imaginary part of the spectrum matrix, which
        is called the quaspectrum matrix, can be calculated at each frequency i by MISSING TEXT HERE</p>
    <p>These two matrixes give much information about wave properties. These properties were exploited by Born
        and Wolf (1970) to analyze optical signals and by Rankin and Kurtz (1970) to analyze micropulsations. Means
        (1972) showed that the direction of propagation can be directly obtained from the matrix <i>Q<sub>i</sub></i>.</p>
    <h4>Coherence</h4>
    <p>The coherence between signals 1 and signals 2 is defined by <span class='attention'>MISSING TEXT HERE</span>,
        where <i>C<sub>ij</sub></i> is
        the ij-component of the cospectrum and <i>Q<sub>ij</sub></i> is the ij-component of the quaspectrum.</p>
    <h4>Phase</h4>
    <p>Phase is the difference, expressed in degrees or radians, between two waves having the same frequency and
        referenced to the same point in time. The 1,2 phase is defined as <span class='attention'>MISSING TEXT HERE</span></p>
    <h3>Tools &gt; Edit</h3>
    <p>The Edit window allows you to perform matrix rotation and filtering. You can either click the Custom Rotation
        button to specify a custom rotation or click the Minimum Variance button to calculate the minimum variance
        matrix, and then transform the magnetic field vector to the new coordinate. You can also click the Filter
        button to filter the data.</p>
    <h4>Minimum Variance</h4>
    <p>By solving an eigenvalue problem, it is possible to calculate the rotation matrix that rotates a vector time
        series into a coordinate system in which the direction of the coordinate axes are those of the maximum
        variance, the minimum variance, and an intermediate variance. The eigenvectors are the rows of the
        transformation matrix and the eigenvalues are the variances along each direction. These directions are called
        the principal axes. The system is also called the minimum variance coordinate system. It can often be used at
        the magnetopause, but not at shocks. Usually, the direction in which the magnetic field has a minimum variance
        is the direction normal to the magnetopause.</p>
    <p>Assume the data set you choose is [<i>B<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>B<sub>2</sub></i>,
        &hellip;, <i>B<sub>N</sub></i>] and construct a variance matrix <i>M</i>. Nine terms of <i>M</i> are <i>m<sub>ij</sub></i>
        (i and j represent the x, y, and z components). Assume the eigenvalues of <i>M</i> are <i>&lambda;<sub>&mu;</sub></i>
        (<i>&mu;</i>=1,2,3) and the eigenvectors that form the transformation matrix are <i>V<sub>&mu;</sub></i>,
        <i>MV<sub>&mu;</sub></i> = <i>&lambda;<sub>&mu;</sub></i>
        <i>V<sub>&mu;</sub></i>.</p>
    <h3>Options</h3>
    <p>The Options menu allows you to change the style of the plot. You can choose to scale the y-range of the data
        to the current time selection, to draw smooth, antialiased lines, to bridge the gaps between data, and to
        draw only data points rathern than lines between those points.</p>
    <h2>Main Plot Window</h2>
    <h3>Time Interval Selection Bar</h3>
    <p>The time interval selection bar allows you to change the time interval of the data plotted in the program's
        main window. The top bar controls the start time and the bottom bar controls the stop time.</p>
    <h3>Trace Stats</h3>
    <p>The Trace Stats window appears when you click the start and stop time you are interested in on the main
        plotting window. It shows you the minimum value, maximum value, mean value, median value, and standard
        deviation of the magnetic field data in the time interval you choose.</p>
    <p>Suppose [<i>x<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, &hellip;, <i>x<sub>N</sub></i>] is the data set of one
        component of the vector magnetic field or the total magnetic field in the time interval you choose. Minimum
        is the smallest value of this data set and maximum is the largest value. The median is the value separating
        the higher
        half from the lower half of the data set. Suppose the mean value is <i>&mu;</i> and the standard deviation
        is <i>&sigma;.</i></p>
